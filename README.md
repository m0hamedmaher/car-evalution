## Car Evaluation Dataset Analysis

### Overview

This project was undertaken during my training at NTI, where I aimed to analyze and model a car evaluation dataset from Kaggle. The project involved defining the problem, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing the data, and applying a Decision Tree model to evaluate car conditions.

### Dataset

The dataset is available on Kaggle and contains multiple features related to car evaluations. You can find the dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elikplim/car-evaluation-data-set).

### Project Steps

#### 1. Define the Problem
The main objective was to predict the evaluation class of a car based on various attributes like buying price, maintenance cost, number of doors, capacity, and more.

#### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performed EDA to understand the distribution of data, identify patterns, and explore relationships between different variables. Visualizations and summary statistics were used to gain insights.

#### 3. Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing steps included:
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Scaling numerical features (if necessary)
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets

#### 4. Decision Tree Model
A Decision Tree model was chosen for its simplicity and interpretability. The model was trained on the training set and evaluated on the testing set. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used to assess the model.

### Files

- `EDA.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing exploratory data analysis.
- `Preprocessing.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook detailing the data preprocessing steps.
- `Decision_Tree_Model.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook where the Decision Tree model is implemented, trained, and evaluated.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

### Results

The Decision Tree model performed well, providing insights into which features are most important for predicting car evaluations. Detailed results and visualizations are included in the respective notebooks.

### Conclusion

This project enhanced my understanding of data analysis and machine learning. It provided practical experience in handling real-world datasets and applying machine learning techniques to derive meaningful insights.
